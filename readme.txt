Make your WordPress login extra secure with One Time Passwords.

== Description ==

With WP-OTP you can easily set up 2 Factor Authentication with One Time Passwords for your WordPress login.
This extra layer makes your WordPress site a lot more secure.

The new stealth mode allows for invisible OTP code entry, making your login screen look like any other, no extra OTP code input field.

= Getting started =
After installing and activating the plugin, every user can enable WP-OTP on their profile page.

It's as easy as scanning the provided QR Code or entering the OTP secret to any OTP generator app.
Then just activate it by entering the generated OTP and voilà, all set up.
Now, the login requires an OTP code to succeed.

Each user gets their own secret key to authenticate with, giving them control over their login security.

= Development =
This plugin is completely open source and a work of passion.
If you would like to be part of it and join in, make your way over to the [project page](https://git.feneas.org/noplanman/wp-otp) now.

= Filters =

* `wp_otp_qr_code_provisioning_uri`: URI for online QR Code rendering (must contain `{PROVISIONING_URI}` placeholder for QR Code data).
* `wp_otp_login_form_text`: Text for input field on the login screen.
* `wp_otp_login_form_text_sub`: Subtext for the input field on the login screen.
* `wp_otp_login_form_invalid_code_text`: Error text for an invalid code input on the login screen.
* `wp_otp_code_expiration_window`: Set the window of code verification expiration.
* `wp_otp_recovery_codes_count`: Number of recovery codes to generate.

For an automated installation:

2. Search for the 'WP OTP' plugin.
3. Install by clicking the 'Install Now' button.
4. Activate the plugin on the 'Plugins' page in your WordPress Admin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What if I lose my OTP authenticator? =
No problem! When activating WP-OTP, you will also get a list of recovery codes that you can use instead of entering the OTP from your authenticator app.
Be sure to regenerate them when you run out though, or better yet, reconfigure your WP-OTP to get a new secret and a new set of recovery codes.

= Can I reset my OTP secret key? =
Yes, just click the `Reconfigure` button on the profile page.

= Why is there no OTP input field on the login form? =
Your site admin has either disabled the plugin or enabled stealth mode.
This means that you will need to add your OTP (or recovery) code at the end of your password.
